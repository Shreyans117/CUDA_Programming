# CUDA_Programming
CUDA Programming Projects
Implemented the following:
1. Matrix Addition (memcpy operations and optimized number of thread blocks)
2. Array Reduction (coalesced memory accesses)
3. Matrix Multiplication (shared memory tiling)
4. Histogram Analysis (atomic operations, shared memory)
