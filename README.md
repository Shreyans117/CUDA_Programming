# CUDA_Programming
Implemented the following:
1. Matrix Addition (memcpy operations and optimized number of thread blocks)
2. Array Reduction (coalesced memory accesses)
3. Matrix Multiplication (shared memory tiling)
4. Histogram Analysis (atomic operations, shared memory)
5. Ported an existing C backpropagation algorithm to CUDA
